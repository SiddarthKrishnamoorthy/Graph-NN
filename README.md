# Graph Convolutional Nets

Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Theano based on [(kpif et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907). You can find their code in Pytorch and Tensoflow [here](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn).

For a high-level explanation, have a look at their blog post:

Thomas Kipf, [Graph Convolutional Networks](http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) (2016)

## Running the code(demo)

```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements
* theano
* networkx (to unpack the dataset)
